# Telestrations: Design Decisions

Decisions made during design session on 2026-03-18.

---

## Architecture

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js | Existing preference |
| Database | Neon + Drizzle ORM | Serverless Postgres, unlimited free projects; Drizzle schema-as-code eliminates the manual types.ts/migration split |
| Realtime | Ably | 6M messages/month free, 200 concurrent connections; channel-scoping model is identical to what was planned for Supabase Realtime |
| Deployment | Internet-hosted | Players join via room code at a public URL; no LAN required |
| Device model | Host screen + player phones | Host screen on TV/laptop (browser); each player uses their own phone to draw/guess |

---

## Room & Lobby

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Auth | Ephemeral — nickname only, no accounts, no persistence after game ends |
| Room creation | Any player can create a room; creator becomes host |
| Join method | 6-character room code |
| Host powers | Start game, advance reveal, control game flow from either their phone or the host screen (TV) |

---

## Players & Game Setup

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Player count | 4–12 (full range) |
| Odd player handling | Supported — chain length = N−1 for odd N; owner writes word but does not draw; book passed to left neighbor first; last entry always a guess |
| Rounds | Host-configured (not fixed at 3) |
| Prompts | Player chooses from 2–3 options at round start (not random auto-assign) |

---

## Gameplay

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Drawing style | Simultaneous — all players draw at the same time |
| Timer | 60 seconds, server-authoritative (`timer_started_at` stored in DB; local timer is cosmetic only) |
| Early submission | Player waits silently on a "waiting for others" screen |
| Round advances when | All players have submitted OR timer expires |
| Disconnection | Game continues; disconnected player's slot becomes a blank entry |
| Drawing tool | Simple finger/mouse canvas for now (brush size, no color picker initially) |
| Drawing storage | JSON path data (array of strokes/points) — compact, re-renderable, easy to replay |

---

## Chain Routing

The core data structure is a chain of alternating drawings and guesses per "book" (one book per player per round).

**Even N players:**
- Chain length = N entries
- Owner draws entry 1 (their own word)
- Entry P authored by seat `(owner_seat + P - 1) % N`
- Last entry (P = N, even) is a guess ✓

**Odd N players:**
- Chain length = N−1 entries
- Owner writes word but does NOT draw; book is passed to left neighbor first
- Entry P authored by seat `(owner_seat + P) % N`
- Owner reveals the book but does not add a final entry
- Last entry (P = N−1, even) is a guess ✓

---

## Host Screen

| Phase | What host screen shows |
|---|---|
| Lobby | Player list, room code, start button |
| Active play | Countdown timer + names of players who haven't submitted yet |
| Reveal | Cinematic chain flip — one book at a time, host advances manually |

The host can advance the reveal from either:
- The TV browser (keyboard/click)
- Their player phone (host controls section)

Both publish to the same Ably channel.

---

## Reveal Flow

- Books revealed one at a time (not all simultaneously)
- Host manually advances through each entry in the chain
- Player phones show the chain entry they personally contributed, highlighted in context
- `reveal_book_index` and `reveal_entry_index` tracked in `rooms` table

---

## Scoring

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Modes | Full implementation: both friendly and competitive |
| Correctness | Fuzzy string match computed on submission; book owner can override (mark correct/incorrect) |
| Friendly scoring | Players vote for favorite sketch and favorite guess per book after reveal |
| Competitive scoring | Points for correct guess + points for drawing that led to a correct guess |

## Open Questions / Future Work

- Drawing tool enhancements (color picker, eraser, undo) — deferred
- Additional prompt categories or custom word entry by host — deferred
- Timer duration configurable by host (currently fixed at 60s) — not decided
